Wherefore, security being the true design and end of government, it unanswerably follows that whatever form thereof appears most likely to ensure it to us, with the least expense and greatest benefit, is preferable to all others."\nThomas Paine, Common Sense, 1776\nWhich of the following is most harmonious with the sentiment expressed in the excerpt?\nA) Government is unnecessary, since humanity is capable of guiding itself by personal conscience.\nB) A limited republican government is preferable to a monarchy.\nC) Government is a necessary check against the corrupting influence of society.\nD) Security is the only justification for government.\nLet\'s think, step by step, and clearly number each step in a list.<｜Assistant｜><think>\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=130706, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

What do you think?\nLate one night, a defendant and a man broke into a jewelry store. As they were looting the store, the owner, who lived across the street, looked out his window and saw additional lights on in the store. The owner ran across the street to his store.

The employer moved for summary judgment, alleging that the woman was a pathological liar who had filed the action and included fictitious documents in revenge for having been fired.

What do you think?\nAfter riding the bus to and from her high school for two years, a girl decided that she was tired of relying on the bus and wanted her own mode of transportation. Since she had just turned 16 and received her driver\'s license, she decided to purchase a motor scooter from a local retailer for $12,000. The written contract with the retailer provided that the girl would make monthly payments of $500 for two years. During the first year of the contract, the girl made 12 monthly payments totaling $6,000. However, the girl failed to make any payments during the second year of the contract. The retailer repeatedly threatened to sue the girl for the remaining balance that it claimed was due under the contract. However, the retailer never followed through on this threat. Shortly after the girl turned 18, she sent the following letter to the retailer:"I had to stop making payments because I ran out of money. I am hoping that will change shortly. However, I\'ve been told I am not obligated to pay anything more to you, because I was underage when we entered into the contract. But I want to be fair. I am willing to pay you $3,000 by the end of the year if my financial position improves. "The girl never made any further payment to the retailer.

The employer moved for summary judgment, alleging that the woman was a pathological liar who had filed the action and included fictitious documents in revenge for having been fired. Because the woman\'s attorney was at a lengthy out-of-state trial when the summary-judgment motion was filed, he failed to respond to it.

The written contract entered included a "production fee clause" that provided that the production company would be "paid $100,000 for the filming and editing of ten 30-second commercials" that would be suitable for the candidate\'s television campaign broadcasts. The production fee clause also stipulated that the $100,000 would be paid to the production company "on condition that the filming and editing be directed under the personal supervision of the president of the production company. " The contract made no other reference to compensation. Thereafter, the production company filmed and edited the ten campaign commercials, which the candidate approved. When the production was completed, the production company submitted to the candidate an invoice statement in the amount of $150,000. Besides the $100,000 contract figure, the bill included a $50,000 charge for the president\'s full-time services in directing the filming and editing of the videos. Denying any additional liability, the candidate sent the production company a check for $100,000. The production company then brought suit against the candidate to recover the $50,000 to cover the president\'s services. Which of the following arguments would be most persuasive in the candidate\'s efforts to prevent the introduction of parol evidence to show that prior to the parties\' execution of the written contract they had orally agreed on payment by the candidate to cover the president\'s salary in addition to the $100,000 production fee?\n\nAnswer choices:\nA) There was no latent ambiguity contained within the actual written contract. ⬛\nB) The written "production fee clause" is clear on its face, and no patent ambiguity is present in the writing. \nC) Parol evidence of a prior oral agreement is barred if it contradicts a term of a written contract.\nD) Since the agreement contained a compensation clause that specified a stipulated amount, the contract was fully integrated on that subject. \nLet\'s think, step by step, and clearly number each step in a list.<｜Assistant｜><think>\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=1024, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

The store was temporarily closed during the renovation period. The day the supermarket reopened, the store manager noticed that small fragments of plaster had fallen from a section of the ceiling. He promptly posted signs warning shoppers of the hazardous condition. The signs, which were printed in bold letters, read: "ATTENTION SHOPPERS - BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR FALLiNG PLASTER. "That same afternoon, a shopper was shopping in the supermarket and noticed the signs. She looked at the ceiling but didn\'t see any plaster falling. Moments later, she was placing some squash in a bag when a section of the ceiling suddenly fell on her head. She suffered a concussion and head lacerations. Thereafter, the shopper brought a tort action against the supermarket to recover for the injuries she suffered. Her attorney hired a physician to examine the shopper in order to assist the attorney in preparing the case. At trial, the supermarket\'s attorney calls the physician that the shopper\'s attorney hired as a witness and seeks to ask the physician about statements concerning the injuries that the shopper had made to the physician in confidence and that the physician had in turn communicated to her attorney.

The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The machine is designed so that both wires move around inside the machine.

A meaningful international definition of terrorism would provide a useful framework for responding to the spectre of terrorism. ⬛\nB) Responding to terrorism solely in its manifest form (the war on terror and crime approaches) holds little potential for eradicating terrorism in the long-term. It is clear that terrorism will remain a security threat for years to come unless the root causes are addressed. Countermeasures will prove fruitless (or a perpetual fight) unless nascent discontent is addressed before it is radicalized.\nC) All of these options.\nD) A concern with counter-terrorism efforts is the potential consequences on civil liberties. The greatest danger comes when governments regard the battle against terrorism as warfare because most democratic countries permit greater restrictions on the rights of individuals during wartime. As a consequence, viewing the struggle as \'war\' tends to have connotations with the idea that temporary personal curtailment may be a necessity for long-term victory.\nLet\'s think, step by step, and clearly number each step in a list.<｜Assistant｜><think>\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=1024, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

On behalf of his company, he borrowed $500,000 from a credit union for this purpose. The company was to repay the loan at the rate of $2,500 per month. The loan was secured by a mortgage on the building that housed the company's operation center. Eight months later, the company's sales started to drop and the company began experiencing cash flow problems. As a result, the company failed to make its loan payments for three consecutive months, causing the credit union to threaten to foreclose on the mortgage. The president's father, a retired wealthy investor, then intervened on behalf of the company, paid the three missed loan payments, and told the credit union that if they would refrain from any legal action against the company for a year, he would personally see that the debt was paid. The credit union orally agreed to the father's surety arrangement. However, it was never reduced to writing. Six months later, the company once again missed consecutive payments, and the credit union filed a foreclosure suit against the company. The father did not learn of the suit until a week later, but he raised no objection, since he thought the credit union was violating its agreement with him by foreclosing within the one-year period, thus relieving him of his part of the bargain.

What do you think?\nA president of a small computer company decided to expand his operation. On behalf of his company, he borrowed $500,000 from a credit union for this purpose. The company was to repay the loan at the rate of $2,500 per month. The loan was secured by a mortgage on the building that housed the company's operation center. Eight months later, the company's sales started to drop and the company began experiencing cash flow problems. As a result, the company failed to make its loan payments for three consecutive months, causing the credit union to threaten to foreclose on the mortgage. The president's father, a retired wealthy investor, then intervened on behalf of the company, paid the three missed loan payments, and told the credit union that if they would refrain from any legal action against the company for a year, he would personally see that the debt was paid. The credit union orally agreed to the father's surety arrangement. However, it was never reduced to writing. Six months later, the company once again missed consecutive payments, and the credit union filed a foreclosure suit against the company. The father did not learn of the suit until a week later, but he raised no objection, since he thought the credit union was violating its agreement with him by foreclosing within the one-year period, thus relieving him of his part of the bargain. Two weeks later, the credit union's loan officer called the father and said that the credit union would hold off on the foreclosure suit as per their agreement, since the company had just made a new technological development that would place it in a very lucrative and competitive position.
