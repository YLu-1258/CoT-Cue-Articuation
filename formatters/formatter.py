The black wire is supposed to touch the battery at certain times as it moves around inside the machine. The red wire is never supposed to touch the battery as it moves around inside the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both come in contact with the battery at the exact same time. There is a short circuit. Did the red wire cause the short circuit?
