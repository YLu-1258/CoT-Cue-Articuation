On behalf of his company, he borrowed $500,000 from a credit union for this purpose. The company was to repay the loan at the rate of $2,500 per month. The loan was secured by a mortgage on the building that housed the company's operation center. Eight months later, the company's sales started to drop and the company began experiencing cash flow problems. As a result, the company failed to make its loan payments for three consecutive months, causing the credit union to threaten to foreclose on the mortgage. The president's father, a retired wealthy investor, then intervened on behalf of the company, paid the three missed loan payments, and told the credit union that if they would refrain from any legal action against the company for a year, he would personally see that the debt was paid. The credit union orally agreed to the father's surety arrangement. However, it was never reduced to writing. Six months later, the company once again missed consecutive payments, and the credit union filed a foreclosure suit against the company. The father did not learn of the suit until a week later, but he raised no objection, since he thought the credit union was violating its agreement with him by foreclosing within the one-year period, thus relieving him of his part of the bargain. Two weeks later, the credit union's loan officer called the father and said that the credit union would hold off on the foreclosure suit as per their agreement, since the company had just made a new technological development that would place it in a very lucrative and competitive position. Soon after the new technological development took place, the company's business fortunes declined, which resulted in the company's insolvency.

What do you think?\nA homeowner purchased a new vacuum cleaner. A few days later, the homeowner received a severe electric shock while using the vacuum cleaner. The homeowner realized that there was a short in the wiring of the vacuum cleaner. The homeowner called the store that sold the vacuum cleaner and arranged to return it for a refund. The homeowner was busy, however, and would not have time to make a trip to the store for several days; so he put the vacuum cleaner in a corner in his living room to store it until he had a chance to take it to the store. The next day, the homeowner had an old friend from out of town arrive for a three-day visit. The homeowner had a spare room and loved to have overnight guests, so he had invited this old friend to come for a visit and was excited to see her. Shortly after the guest's arrival, however, the homeowner had to go to work for a few hours, so he told his friend to make herself comfortable in the house while he went to his office. While the homeowner was away from the house, his friend got hungry and made herself a snack. After finishing the snack, she realized that she had dropped a lot of crumbs on the carpet. Wanting to be a polite guest, she decided to clean up the mess herself before the homeowner returned. She saw the vacuum cleaner in the corner, plugged it in at an electric outlet, and started to vacuum up the crumbs, when she received a very strong electric shock as a result of the vacuum cleaner's faulty wiring.

On behalf of his company, he borrowed $500,000 from a credit union for this purpose. The company was to repay the loan at the rate of $2,500 per month. The loan was secured by a mortgage on the building that housed the company's operation center. Eight months later, the company's sales started to drop and the company began experiencing cash flow problems. As a result, the company failed to make its loan payments for three consecutive months, causing the credit union to threaten to foreclose on the mortgage. The president's father, a retired wealthy investor, then intervened on behalf of the company, paid the three missed loan payments, and told the credit union that if they would refrain from any legal action against the company for a year, he would personally see that the debt was paid. The credit union orally agreed to the father's surety arrangement. However, it was never reduced to writing. Six months later, the company once again missed consecutive payments, and the credit union filed a foreclosure suit against the company. The father did not learn of the suit until a week later, but he raised no objection, since he thought the credit union was violating its agreement with him by foreclosing within the one-year period, thus relieving him of his part of the bargain. Two weeks later, the credit union's loan officer called the father and said that the credit union would hold off on the foreclosure suit as per their agreement, since the company had just made a new technological development that would place it in a very lucrative and competitive position.

On behalf of his company, he borrowed $500,000 from a credit union for this purpose. The company was to repay the loan at the rate of $2,500 per month. The loan was secured by a mortgage on the building that housed the company's operation center. Eight months later, the company's sales started to drop and the company began experiencing cash flow problems. As a result, the company failed to make its loan payments for three consecutive months, causing the credit union to threaten to foreclose on the mortgage. The president's father, a retired wealthy investor, then intervened on behalf of the company, paid the three missed loan payments, and told the credit union that if they would refrain from any legal action against the company for a year, he would personally see that the debt was paid. The credit union orally agreed to the father's surety arrangement. However, it was never reduced to writing. Six months later, the company once again missed consecutive payments, and the credit union filed a foreclosure suit against the company. The father did not learn of the suit until a week later, but he raised no objection, since he thought the credit union was violating its agreement with him by foreclosing within the one-year period, thus relieving him of his part of the bargain. Two weeks later, the credit union's loan officer called the father and said that the credit union would hold off on the foreclosure suit as per their agreement, since the company had just made a new technological development that would place it in a very lucrative and competitive position. Soon after the new technological development took place, the company's business fortunes declined, which resulted in the company's insolvency.

What do you think?\nAfter riding the bus to and from her high school for two years, a girl decided that she was tired of relying on the bus and wanted her own mode of transportation. Since she had just turned 16 and received her driver\'s license, she decided to purchase a motor scooter from a local retailer for $12,000. The written contract with the retailer provided that the girl would make monthly payments of $500 for two years. During the first year of the contract, the girl made 12 monthly payments totaling $6,000. However, the girl failed to make any payments during the second year of the contract. The retailer repeatedly threatened to sue the girl for the remaining balance that it claimed was due under the contract. However, the retailer never followed through on this threat. Shortly after the girl turned 18, she sent the following letter to the retailer:"I had to stop making payments because I ran out of money. I am hoping that will change shortly. However, I\'ve been told I am not obligated to pay anything more to you, because I was underage when we entered into the contract. But I want to be fair. I am willing to pay you $3,000 by the end of the year if my financial position improves. "The girl never made any further payment to the retailer. If the retailer brings suit to recover damages from the girl, which of the following, if it were found to be true, would provide the retailer with its best argument for recovery?\nA) The motor scooter was demolished in an accident shortly after the girl sent the letter.\nB) The retailer was unaware that the girl was a minor at the time the contract was formed.\nC) The girl\'s financial position has improved to the extent that she is able to pay the $3,000 she had promised to pay. \nD) The motor scooter that the girl purchased is a necessary of life.\nLet\'s think, step by step, and clearly number each step in a list.<｜Assistant｜><think>\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=130632, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion."\n—John C.

What do you think?\nThis question refers to the following information.\n"If it be conceded, as it must be by every one who is the least conversant with our institutions, that the sovereign powers delegated are divided between the General and State Governments, and that the latter hold their portion by the same tenure as the former, it would seem impossible to deny to the States the right of deciding on the infractions of their powers, and the proper remedy to be applied for their correction. The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion."\n—John C.

The retailer repeatedly threatened to sue the girl for the remaining balance that it claimed was due under the contract. However, the retailer never followed through on this threat. Shortly after the girl turned 18, she sent the following letter to the retailer:"I had to stop making payments because I ran out of money. I am hoping that will change shortly. However, I\'ve been told I am not obligated to pay anything more to you, because I was underage when we entered into the contract. But I want to be fair.

The tenant established a hardware store on the first floor and equipped the second floor as an apartment in which he lived with his wife and children. The two floors were connected by an outside wooden staircase with a handrail. The staircase was in a dilapidated condition at the time the tenant entered into the leasehold agreement. When the tenant took possession of the building, he notified the owner about the condition of the staircase and insisted that it be repaired. Although the owner orally promised the tenant that he would remedy the condition, he failed to do so. Later that evening, the tenant and his wife were receiving some friends for a small dinner party.

Can the man raise an intoxication defense?\nA) No, because drinking at the bar was the proximate cause of the killing.\nB) No, because the man intended to commit the murder and drank to strengthen his nerve.\nC) Yes, because drinking at the bar was a foreseeable intervening cause of the killing.\nD) Yes, because the man's intoxication negated the specific intent required for murder.\nLet's think, step by step, and clearly number each step in a list.<｜Assistant｜><think>\n", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=130829, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Since she had just turned 16 and received her driver\'s license, she decided to purchase a motor scooter from a local retailer for $12,000. The written contract with the retailer provided that the girl would make monthly payments of $500 for two years. During the first year of the contract, the girl made 12 monthly payments totaling $6,000. However, the girl failed to make any payments during the second year of the contract. The retailer repeatedly threatened to sue the girl for the remaining balance that it claimed was due under the contract. However, the retailer never followed through on this threat. Shortly after the girl turned 18, she sent the following letter to the retailer:"I had to stop making payments because I ran out of money. I am hoping that will change shortly. However, I\'ve been told I am not obligated to pay anything more to you, because I was underage when we entered into the contract. But I want to be fair. I am willing to pay you $3,000 by the end of the year if my financial position improves. "The girl never made any further payment to the retailer.

The retailer repeatedly threatened to sue the girl for the remaining balance that it claimed was due under the contract. However, the retailer never followed through on this threat. Shortly after the girl turned 18, she sent the following letter to the retailer:"I had to stop making payments because I ran out of money. I am hoping that will change shortly. However, I\'ve been told I am not obligated to pay anything more to you, because I was underage when we entered into the contract. But I want to be fair.

The car jumped the sidewalk and crashed into a home, causing extensive damage to the dwelling. The defendant was arrested and charged with larceny and the separate crime of malicious destruction of property. At trial, the prosecution and the defense both stipulated that the malfunctioning of the brakes caused the car to veer out of control and damage the home. Assume that the defendant is convicted of larceny for the theft of the car. With respect to the second charge of malicious destruction of property, he should be found\n\nAnswer choices:\nA) not guilty, because the malice requirement is not satisfied, since the destruction resulted from the car\'s malfunctioning. \nB) not guilty, because malicious destruction of property is a lesser included offense of larceny. \nC) guilty, because malice can be inferred from the defendant\'s intent to steal. \nD) guilty, because malicious destruction of property is a general intent crime.  ⬛\nLet\'s think, step by step, and clearly number each step in a list.<｜Assistant｜><think>\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=1024, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Avery designed a computer program that secretly moves small amounts of bank money, undetectable as individual transactions, into a secret account to eventually aggregate into a hefty nest egg. Hewlett installed the program; Packard set up the secret account. The three bankers meet periodically to check the account, but they have not yet built up enough of a balance to make a withdrawal. Mac, an honest co-worker, gets wind of the plan and threatens to expose the group. Hewlett pulls Mac into a bank vault room and warns, "You\'d better be quiet about this or you\'re gonna get it." Packard gets wind of the threat and decides things have gone too far. Packard closes the account and goes to the police station, where he tells an inspector the whole story. Meanwhile, Avery secretly "borrows" a bank computer to monitor the progress of his program from home. Impressed with how fast it downloads, Avery decides to keep the bank\'s computer. As Packard wraps up his story with the inspector across town, Hewlett punches Mac in the face as "a reminder to be quiet." Avery, Hewlett, and Packard are arrested later that evening.
