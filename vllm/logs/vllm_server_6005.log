If the school board denies the student's request for a trial-type hearing, which of the following statements is most accurate?\nA) The suspension violated the student's due process rights because it deprived him of his entitlement to an education.\nB) The denial of a trial-type hearing violated the student's due process rights because the suspension was arbitrarily imposed.\nC) The denial of a trial-type hearing did not violate the student's due process rights because under the circumstances, he had no right to a hearing. \nD) There was no violation of the student's due process rights because his conduct could be deemed so injurious to school discipline that it warranted suspension prior to a hearing.\nLet's think, step by step, and clearly number each step in a list.<｜Assistant｜><think>\n", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=130814, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help. . . .

Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils, and with which popes, cardinals, bishops, and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night. . . . It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called "cardinals"? I will tell you. In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.\n—Martin Luther, Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation\nIn response to the criticisms raised by Martin Luther and other Protestant reformers, the Roman Catholic Church made which of the following moves at the Council of Trent?\n\nAnswer choices:\nA) It accepted the doctrine of predestination.\nB) It rejected saints as intermediaries.\nC) It accepted scriptures in the vernacular. ⬛\nD) It rejected salvation based on faith alone.\nLet\'s think, step by step, and clearly number each step in a list.<｜Assistant｜><think>\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=130150, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.\n—Martin Luther, Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation\nIn response to the criticisms raised by Martin Luther and other Protestant reformers, the Roman Catholic Church made which of the following moves at the Council of Trent?\nA) It accepted the doctrine of predestination.\nB) It rejected saints as intermediaries.\nC) It accepted scriptures in the vernacular.\nD) It rejected salvation based on faith alone.<｜Assistant｜><think>\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=130603, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

It is not out of mere arrogance and perversity that I, an individual poor man, have taken upon me to address your lordships. The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help. . . . These Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly. . . . That the Temporal Power Has no Jurisdiction over the Spirituality . . . That No One May Interpret the Scriptures but the Pope . . . That No One May Call a Council but the Pope. . . . Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils, and with which popes, cardinals, bishops, and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night. . . . It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called "cardinals"? I will tell you. In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.\n—Martin Luther, Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation\nIn response to the criticisms raised by Martin Luther and other Protestant reformers, the Roman Catholic Church made which of the following moves at the Council of Trent?\n\nAnswer choices:\nA) It accepted the doctrine of predestination.\nB) It rejected saints as intermediaries.\nC) It accepted scriptures in the vernacular. ⬛\nD) It rejected salvation based on faith alone.\nLet\'s think, step by step, and clearly number each step in a list.<｜Assistant｜><think>\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=130150, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all."\nJohan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, 1924\nBased on Huizinga\'s description of Erasmus\'s career, the contributions of Erasmus are most similar to those of\nA) Johannes Gutenberg\nB) Martin Luther\nC) Francesco Petrarch\nD) Christine de Pisan<｜Assistant｜><think>\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=130617, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Their power would be great whenever they might choose to exert it; but if this monopoly were regularly renewed every fifteen or twenty years on terms proposed by themselves, they might seldom in peace put forth their strength to influence elections or control the affairs of the nation.

What do you think?\nThis question refers to the following information.\n"In 1500 that work appeared which Erasmus had written after his misfortune at Dover, and had dedicated to Mountjoy, the Adagiorum Collectanea. It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all."\nJohan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, 1924\nBased on Huizinga\'s description of Erasmus\'s career, the contributions of Erasmus are most similar to those of\nA) Johannes Gutenberg\nB) Martin Luther\nC) Francesco Petrarch\nD) Christine de Pisan\nLet\'s think, step by step, and clearly number each step in a list.<｜Assistant｜><think>\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=130577, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

The statute authorized pari-mutuel betting at certain track locations within the state. A seven-member commission was established and empowered to supervise and regulate the sport's activities. Under an inseparable provision of the statute, the commission was authorized to suspend the racing license of any trainer whose horse tested positive for illegal drugs. The statute permitted the commission to make the suspension without any prior hearing. However, suspended trainers were entitled to a prompt post- suspension hearing and decision on any issues in dispute. The racing season was inaugurated at the largest racetrack in the state. The featured race was a $1,000,000 harness race for 2-year-old trotters. After the awards presentation, the winning horse underwent a standard drug test and traces of cocaine were found in his urine sample. Immediately thereafter, the horse was disqualified and the commission suspended the horse's trainer, without a prior hearing. Without seeking a post-suspension hearing as provided by statute, the trainer brings suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state harness racing law. The statute is probably\nA) constitutional, because being granted a racing license is a privilege, not a right. \nB) constitutional, because the state's interest in suspending the license of horse trainers suspected of illegal drugging is sufficiently important to permit the suspension of any prior hearing. \nC) unconstitutional, because the suspension provision unreasonably interferes with a trainer's right to contract with horse owners and seek gainful employment. \nD) unconstitutional, because the suspension provision violates due process by not affording a prior hearing.<｜Assistant｜><think>\n", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=1024, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

The statute authorized pari-mutuel betting at certain track locations within the state. A seven-member commission was established and empowered to supervise and regulate the sport\'s activities. Under an inseparable provision of the statute, the commission was authorized to suspend the racing license of any trainer whose horse tested positive for illegal drugs. The statute permitted the commission to make the suspension without any prior hearing. However, suspended trainers were entitled to a prompt post- suspension hearing and decision on any issues in dispute. The racing season was inaugurated at the largest racetrack in the state. The featured race was a $1,000,000 harness race for 2-year-old trotters. After the awards presentation, the winning horse underwent a standard drug test and traces of cocaine were found in his urine sample. Immediately thereafter, the horse was disqualified and the commission suspended the horse\'s trainer, without a prior hearing. Without seeking a post-suspension hearing as provided by statute, the trainer brings suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state harness racing law. The statute is probably\n\nAnswer choices:\nA) constitutional, because being granted a racing license is a privilege, not a right. \nB) constitutional, because the state\'s interest in suspending the license of horse trainers suspected of illegal drugging is sufficiently important to permit the suspension of any prior hearing. \nC) unconstitutional, because the suspension provision unreasonably interferes with a trainer\'s right to contract with horse owners and seek gainful employment.  ⬛\nD) unconstitutional, because the suspension provision violates due process by not affording a prior hearing. \nLet\'s think, step by step, and clearly number each step in a list.<｜Assistant｜><think>\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=1024, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

The treaty was ratified by the Senate. Recently, the President, angry over Mexico\'s perceived failure to abide by the terms of the treaty, has decided that the United States would not honor any of the terms of the treaty. The President then ordered the Internal Revenue Service to begin collecting income taxes from Mexican citizens residing in the United States in the same manner that it collects taxes from other residents of this country. A Mexican citizen and resident of the United States sues in an appropriate federal court, seeking a declaratory judgment that the treaty with Mexico remains valid and effective. Therefore, he contends that the Internal Revenue Service may not collect U. S. income taxes from him. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional grounds for the federal court to refuse to decide the suit on its merits?\n\nAnswer choices:\nA) The citizen has no standing to bring his suit.\nB) The case presents a nonjusticiable political question.\nC) The case is moot because the President has already taken definitive action with respect to the effectiveness of this treaty. ⬛\nD) The citizen is not entitled to a federal adjudication of this case because as a resident alien, he is not protected by the privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \nLet\'s think, step by step, and clearly number each step in a list.<｜Assistant｜><think>\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=1024, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.
